Welcome to Team I.X. GPS Project. In the file gpsProject.py you have access to the code for our project. In order to run the code:
1) You will need to buy a GPS receiver dongle and insert it into your computer.
2) You will then need to open the terminal window and download gpsd.
3) Find out the serial of your GPS receiver and link it to gpsd (the command varies based on the computer).

Once you have done all of this you should be set to go! Have fun!!
